MCSC 6020 G - MIDTERM

TO RUN CODE:

- OPEN kMeansClustering.py
- ENSURE ALL IMPORT LIBRARIES ARE INSTALLED
- SELECT RUN FROM MENU
- SELECT kMeansClustering

NOTES:
- DURING DEVELOPMENT, THERE WAS A BUG THAT
  WAS PATCHED AND ENDED UP CREATING DEPENDENCES
  AMONG FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS
- THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION COMPARES LLOYDS
  ALGORITHM TO KMEANS++ (PYTHON, SKLEARN)
	- IT PLOTS AND SAVES IMAGES TO PROJECT
	  FOLDERS FOR THAT ARRANGEMENT
- A BETTER VERSION WOULD BE MORE MODULAR AND
  POSSIBLY MORE OBJECT ORIENTED
